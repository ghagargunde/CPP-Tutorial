//Constructors in C++

/*
A constructor is a special member function with the same name as the class. 
The constructor doesnâ€™t have a return type. 
Constructors are used to initialize the objects of its class. 
Constructors are automatically invoked whenever an object is created.

/*

They are automatically invoked whenever the object is created
They cannot return values and do not have return types
It can have default arguments
We cannot refer to their address
